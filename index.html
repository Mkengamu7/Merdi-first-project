  <h1>My Love for London</h1>

  <p>
    London is one of the cities I love the most. Every time I walk through its streets, I feel a mix of history, culture, and modern life all around me.<br> The city is full of beautiful landmarks, peaceful parks, and lively neighbourhoods. I enjoy exploring places like the River Thames, the museums, and the busy markets. London has a special energy that makes me feel inspired and curious. Whether it is the sound of the Underground, the sight of the red buses, or the smell of fresh food from street vendors, London always feels exciting. Below are some of the things I enjoy the most about this amazing city.
